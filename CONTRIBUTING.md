# How to contribute

If you notice anything wrong with this lib, or want to add a new feature, please create a pull request. I also need to improve the documentation, and add comments to where there aren't any, if you wanna help.

I'll also accept any recommendation about the design, or components I should add, etc.

For now, there are two major components I want to improve by the end of the year: `TextField` and `Scrollbar`, the first being my priority.
